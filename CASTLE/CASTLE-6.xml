      <value>Multiple, incompatible versions of antlr.runtime.dll used in Castle sub-projects</value>
    </field>
    <field name="description">
      <value>A number of Castle projects (AspectSharp, Sandbox/STViewEngine, Sandbox/MonoRail/STViewEngine, Rook, Sandbox/Rook etc) have a dependency on the ANTLR runtime file named antlr.runtime.dll.

Currently every project seems to use a distinct version of antlr.runtime.dll. Giving that:
a) the entire project is [to be fully] built in a single directory and
b) the antlr.runtime.dll is strong named

there are the expected versioning issues and runtime assembly loading errors.


QUESTIONS:
Is there a reason that these other projects are dependent on old (sometime 2 years+) versions of ANTLR?. 

Is there some reason that Rook has a private copy of an old ANTLR/C# runtime source tree?


RECOMMENDATION:
Migrate ALL Castle projects that depend on ANTLR to the latest version of the runtime library. The latest version ia already used by the Sandbox/MonoRail/STViewEngine project.

This migration would involve regenerating Lexer/Parser/TreeParser sources from their respective ANTLR grammar files. Given the age of some of these ANTLR runtime versions, the newly generated files are unlikely to compile against the latest runtime without changes to the grammar files (and perhaps some of the support classes).
