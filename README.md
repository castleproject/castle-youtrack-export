castle-youtrack-export
======================

This repository contains an XML export of all issues that were logged in
Castle's JIRA, Donjon and YouTrack instances over the last decade, as we migrated
the data between each one as we changed software.

The Castle Project now uses GitHub Issues and Pull Requests to keep track of defects,
enhancements and accept contributions. Old data was not imported into GitHub Issues.

To view or log a new issue go to the issues page of the related project:
* https://github.com/castleproject

To view the old issues look in the directory for that project within this repository, or use the GitHub repository search:
* https://github.com/castleproject/castle-youtrack-export/search
