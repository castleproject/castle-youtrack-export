      <value>ArrayResolver attempts to instantiate an unresolvable array dependency</value>
    </field>
    <field name="description">
      <value>When using the ArrayResolver, if I register multiple implementations of an interface and a class that depends on an array of said interfaces, I expect the array resolver to inject all the interface implementations that can be successfully resolved. If a registered implementation of that interface cannot be resolved, it will not be injected into the dependent class (obviously), and the container will not throw an exception.

Starting with Windsor 2.5.1, the ArrayResolver will throw an exception in this situation, but only if the class it is trying to instantiate has multiple constructors.

I am not sure if this change in behavior was intentional or not. I do not see anything in the 2.5.1 breaking changes document that would lead me to believe that this was intentional.
