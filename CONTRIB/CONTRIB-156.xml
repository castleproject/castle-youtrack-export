      <value>Hi, i've submitted it as a bug, but i was using a OneToOne relation incorrectly.

Here is the situation: I've two classes, Album and Photo. On the Album, i have a cover photo, that i've mapped as a BelongsTo attribute and i also have a list of photos, that i've mapped as a OneToMany relation.

What happens is that the only option is to add 2 ManyToOne relations, in oposite directions. So, i can get my CoverAlbum property, but i get an IList&lt;Albums&gt; on my Photo. The Photo only have one Album, witch is mapped as a property Album by the first ManyToOne relation.

As a workaround, i've mapped the BelongsTo property on a partial file...

Leonardo Puglia.</value>
