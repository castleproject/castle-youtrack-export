      <value>As described here:

http://issues.castleproject.org/youtrack/issue/DYNPROXY-161

I'm interested in overriding the dynamic assembly that DynamicProxy generates to. Is it possible to expose a means of doing this?

Thanks!</value>

    <comment author="JeffN825" text="I would like to set them so that all my dynamic classes (both those that I make myself and those that DynamicProxy emits for me) go to the same AssemblyBuilder (and the same emitted dll file). That way my Metro application only has 1 dll to reference. Take the following scenario: I have a simple PCL (portable class library) with ViewModels called MyApp.ViewModels. I want to &quot;augment&quot; these ViewModels with Interceptors, Attributes, etc by generating DynamixProxies for them and save to the AssemblyBuilder dll. Ideally, I'd like to internalize everything necessary to that one dll: &#xA;&#xA;A. Ensure only PCL compatible references are included. &#xA;&#xA;B. Embed the IInterceptor implementations themselves. &#xA;&#xA;C. Embed the IInterceptor interface itself so that a reference to Castle from the dll isn't necessary at all (and thus remains PCL compatible).&#xA;&#xA;D. Strong sign the dll and version it so that it matches the strong name and version (and same identity) of the source MyApp.ViewModels dll." created="1347222974402" updated="1347223121120" />
    <comment author="xtoff" text="Why are your viewmodels in a PCL? Are you reusing them across Silverlight/WPF/WinRT/WP7 ?&#xA;&#xA;anyway, back to your points:&#xA;&#xA;a - couldn't this be done after you've successfully saved the assembly to disk?&#xA;&#xA;b - (and c) this is a huge change, which de-facto changes DynamicProxy to DynamicType generation. &#xA;&#xA;d - that shouldn't be too hard.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;I guess the best way to get going with this is to just fork DP and spike it, and we'll see how best we can approach it once we've got something working." created="1349214841240" />
    <comment author="xtoff" text="also I actually think point D is quite separate so perhaps it'd be best to make it a separate item in the issue tracker" created="1349214918056" />
    <comment author="JeffN825" text="Yes, I'd like to build a WinRT and WPF app and that's why my ViewModels are in a PCL.&#xA;&#xA;To your points.&#xA;A. Yes, I could reload the Assembly instance.&#xA;B and C. I realize that...but it was just an &quot;ideally&quot;&#xA;D. Why do you think D is so separate?
