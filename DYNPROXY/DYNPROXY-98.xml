      <value>Generation time increases exponentially when generating more than 1000 proxies with one Proxybuilder.
My tests showed that this behavior is starting from 150 proxies upwards.

Using multiple Proxybuilders is in my opinion not an option because this increase memory usage.
Actually DP1 had the same problems. Are you planning any improvements soon?

    <comment author="xtoff" text="The performance hit is caused by a SRE class looking for name collision. As you create more proxy types it has to perform more checks, hence observed performance degradation.&#xA;Unfortunately we can't do anything about it.&#xA;&#xA;In most cases taking advantage of proxy type caching is the advisable solution." created="1246632858000" />

    <comment author="firestrand" text="There is a work around:&#xA;As each Type is created it keeps a reference to the Module which is actually a ModuleBuilder. In turn each ModuleBuilder keeps a list of all TypeBuilder objects which have been created in the assembly. Assuming that you keep a HashSet to prevent naming conflicts you can actually use reflection to touch the private m__TypeBuilderList and simply call clear. Doing that is a nasty bit of reflection but it speeds up type creation and removes a good amount of memory being held. I can provide code samples if anyone is interested." created="1269586467000" />
    <comment author="xtoff" text="@Travis Silvers &#xA;&#xA;it seems extremely hacky, but it's better than doing nothing, especially given the fact that last time I checked .NET 4 didn't have a fix for this.&#xA;&#xA;I guess we could provide a switch somewhere that would turn clearing the list on.&#xA;&#xA;so a patch is very much welcome" created="1269591097000" />

    <comment author="xtoff" text="I added workaround based on Travis Silvers's suggestion.&#xA;While generation time is still not linear, it was cut down significantly when large number of types is generated.&#xA;In my machine generating 2000 proxy types from attached solution was cut down from roughly 5minutes to around 2minutes." created="1272195384000" />
