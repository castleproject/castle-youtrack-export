      <value>Poor performance while running in Debug Mode inside Visual Studio 2005</value>

    <field name="description">
      <value>I'm building a 2-tiers application using NHibernate which uses DynamicProxy 1.1.5.
I'm experiencing performance issues at my application startup and I discovered that it is due to the DynamicProxy generation.
I'm always using the method : CreateProxy(Type[] interfaces, IInterceptor interceptor, new object());
For 10 types to generate in DEBUG MODE : it takes 27 seconds if I use one single ProxyGenerator instance and 11 seconds if I use a ProxyGenerator instance per type
In NON DEBUG MODE : it takes respectively 2.5 seconds in the first case and 3 seconds in the second case (so no big difference in NON DEBUG MODE)

Do you have an idea why performances are so BAD when running in Debug mode (which is very important while developping the application)  ?
Is there a solution ?
Thanks a lot for your help !

    <comment author="perlun" text="I ran into this problem recently, and it was quite annoying. However, I did some testing now with Visual Studio 2010, beta 2.&#xA;&#xA;I recompiled my own projects with .NET 4.0, no change (still the bad performance).&#xA;&#xA;I recompiled DynamicProxy with .NET 4.0 as well, and *now* the bug is actually _gone_!!! Which is way cool, great news for us, since DynamicProxy plays a key role in this project.&#xA;&#xA;So, no need to wait for .NET 6.0; this will very likely work with the final version of .NET 4.0 as well." created="1268799329000" />
