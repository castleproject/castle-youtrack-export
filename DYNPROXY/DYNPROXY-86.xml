    <comment author="xtoff" text="DP works just fine.&#xA;&#xA;Proxy target does not get changed, because this line:&#xA;	if (channel != null &amp;&amp; !WcfUtils.IsCommunicationObjectReady(channel))&#xA;evaluates to false.&#xA;&#xA;And please, learn how to create tests. You must be joking if you're expecting me to install some custom certificate." created="1239896673000" />
    <comment author="cneuwirt" text="I am not sure anything can be done about this.  The issue is that once the service is disconnected, WCF doesn't seem to know about it until a request is made, which is too late at that point." created="1240377108000" />
    <comment author="xtoff" text="We may add something like IRecreationPolicy&#xA;try invoke an operation. If we get faulted proxy exception, ask IRecreationPolicy if we should recrete proxy and retry invoking the operation and act accordingly to the answer." created="1241485137000" />
    <comment author="cneuwirt" text="Krzysztof,&#xA;&#xA;I believe the proxy is not yet in a faulted state.  Once the invocation is performed, it becomes faulted.  If I recreate the proxy, how can I retry the current invocation since it has already completed?  Are you thinking I should create a new call internally?" created="1244100857000" />
    <comment author="xtoff" text="If we do it that way, then yes, we should resend messages that we're positive weren't received.&#xA;&#xA;However this is slippery slope on its own, for example we can't say if a oneway message was received or not, unless we use certain bindings.&#xA;&#xA;I think there should be some facility to support this, but due to broken WCF behavior I'm not sure how to implement it, and to what extent." created="1244101812000" />
    <comment author="xtoff" text="First of all this is not a DP issue.&#xA;Second, this is how WCF works, and we can't really do much about it." created="1248494772000" />
    <comment author="cneuwirt" text="This will now work with trunk if you add the ChannelReconnectPolicy to the container or endpoint." created="1248496706000" />
