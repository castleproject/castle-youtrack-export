      <value>Using ValidationHelper with NVelocity layouts</value>
    </field>
    <field name="description">
      <value>Hi,

    I'm using the NVelocity layouts feature and had some troubles when I started to use the ValidationHelper.
In my layout page, I have the following code :

&lt;head&gt;
    $ValidationHelper.InstallScripts()
    $ValidationHelper.SetSubmitOptions(true, true, false, 0)
&lt;/head&gt;

And in my child view page :

&lt;form ... onsubmit="$ValidationHelper.GetValidationTriggerFunction()"&gt;
    ...
&lt;/form&gt;

I tried recently to change the error code in the SetSubmitOptions method but noticed that the change wasn't applied in the onsubmit event of the form. I always had the following code :

onsubmit="return validateForm( this, false, false, false, false, 0 );"

I checked the source code of the ValidationHelper and I think that the problem comes from the fact that the ValidationHelper class stores the submit options in the instance member _submitOptions, and that a new ValidationHelper instance is created for the layout and the child view, so any change made to the submit options in the layout won't be present in the child view.

I tried to move the SetSubmitOptions in the child view, and it works. So I guess this is not a bug, because if you know how the Helper instanciation works for views, it seems logical. However I think it can be troublesome for users because it's kinda hard to figure why the SetSubmitOptions seems to fail, so maybe a little warning in the documentation of the ValidationHelper could help. :)

Also, I'm sorry I don't have any refactoring to submit to enable the use of the SetSubmitOptions in the layout view, since I didn't go as far as looking at the ValidationHelper initialization for NVelocity Views in the source code.</value>
