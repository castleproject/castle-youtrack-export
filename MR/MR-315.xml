      <value>Monorail scaffolding throws an exception during update if the class has a DateTime property.</value>

    <field name="description">
      <value>I have a weird problem with Monorail-ActiveRecord-Scaffolding. I can browse, add and delete items but i can't update them.

I started with a simple class that has a DateTime property with a Version-Attribute. I can add and delete items but update throws an exception

SqlDateTime overflow. Must be between 1/1/1753 12:00:00 AM and 12/31/9999 11:59:59 PM.


Then i replaced the Version-attribute with a normal Property-attribute and tried again. Didn't work. Now the exception was

SQL insert, update or delete failed (expected affected row count: 1, actual affected row count: 0). Possible causes: the row was modified or deleted by another user, or a trigger is reporting misleading row count.


I also created some simple NUnit tests. I verified that i can create, update and delete items. So it seems that the problem is not directly related to ActiveRecord. It's more likely a Monorail/Scaffolding-issue.

Here is a simplified version of my test-class:

    [ActiveRecord("Country")]
    public class Country : ActiveRecordBase&lt;Country&gt;
    {
        private readonly Guid _id;
        private String _name;
        private DateTime _ts;

        public Country()
        {
            _id = Guid.NewGuid();
        }
        [PrimaryKey(PrimaryKeyType.Assigned, "Country_Id", Access = PropertyAccess.FieldCamelcaseUnderscore)]
        public Guid Id
        {
            get { return _id; }
        }

        [Property(Access = PropertyAccess.FieldCamelcaseUnderscore)]
        public string Name
        {
            get { return _name; }
            set { _name = value; }
        }

        [Version(Access = PropertyAccess.FieldCamelcaseUnderscore)]
        public DateTime Ts
        {
            get { return _ts; }
            set { _ts = value; }
        }
    }



Any ideas? Could this be a localization-problem? My server is running with Finnish regional settings.</value>
